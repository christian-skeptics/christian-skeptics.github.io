					<h3>Christian Skeptic: A Contradiction?</h3>
				</div>
				<div id="Content" class="row scroll-container">
					<p>At first glance, the term Christian Skeptic may appear to be a contradiction, but we need to understand some terms, first.</p>
					<div id="TermList", style="margin-left: 50px;">
						<ul>
							<li><b>Contradiction: </b>A statement or phrase containing opposing terms, such as "jumbo shrimp" or "deafening silence".</li>
							<li><b>Paradox: </b>A seemingly self-contradictory statement or phrase that, when investigated or explained, might actually be valid.  Oddly enough, the varying definitions you may find on the internet tend to contradict each other.</li>
							<li><b>Christian: </b>Anyone who believes in the divinity, death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and has accepted Him as Lord and Savior.</li>
							<li><b>Skeptic: </b>Anyone who questions or doubts a common belief.  This is often caused by a (at least percieved) absence or insufficiency of evidence.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>In <b>Hebrews 11:1</b>, Paul states “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”.  However, faith and evidence are generally opposing concepts, as solid evidence turns belief into fact (i.e. scientific method).</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold-center">A Christian Skeptic is a believer who actively seeks outside evidence for their faith (usually in the form of history), and works to clarify difficult or ambiguous passages in Scripture using knowledge of history, culture, and languages.  </p>
					<br>
					<p>If Christianity is true, there must be at least some reliable historical (and possibly archaeological) evidence for it.  It cannot be overstated that this evidence must be carefully vetted and independent (i.e. from a secular source).  Arguably the most popular non-Christian evidence for Christianity is the Testimonium Flavianum, by Josephus Flavius, which states that Jesus “was the Christ”.  Unforetunately, historians and scholars are divided as to it’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/testimonium.html">authenticity</a>, where some regard it as a forgery, while others say it was corrupted or interpolated.</p>
					<br>
					<p>	In our search for evidence, an historical approach is the best strategy.  Science has become a popular method for trying to prove God’s existence or refute evolution.  However, this only distracts us from gathering evidence specifically for Christianity.  After all, even if you prove God exists, <i>which</i> God is it?  The Judeo/Christian God?  Allah?  Brahma, the Hindu God?  Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian God?</p>
					<br>
					<p>To seek better understanding of Scriptures, we need to focus on history first, then culture and languages <!--(?? what order ??)--> and avoid letting theology have too much influence our interpretation, as most theology is, itself, the result of interpretation.  We don’t need to be fluent in Hebrew and Greek, but a working understanding of key words is important (the more, the better).</p>
					<br>
					<p>While personal testimony can be useful by showing a changed life, not everyone will be convinced by testimony, and we must balance the personal side with solid logic, facts, and honest critical thinking.  Christian apologetics has a reputation for weak arguments and dishonesty.  While weak logic is understandable, dishonesty in this area is unacceptable, as it only ends up discrediting us<!--(???HOW???)-->.  Honest critical thinking is admitting we could be wrong, or don’t have an answer to a question.  It is acknowledging when a non-believer has a good argument against a belief or claim, and seeking a better understanding of it (their evidence or logic may be flawed under the surface).</p>
					<br>
					<p>Finally (and probably most controversially), we need to accept that, outside of prophecy and  teachings of faith and morality, the Bible may not be inerrant.  In <b>2 Timothy 3:16-17</b>, Paul states “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”  Nowhere does Paul mention anything about historical or scientific accuracy, as neither are relevant to matters of faith and spirituality.</p>
