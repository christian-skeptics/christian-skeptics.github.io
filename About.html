					<h3>About Me</h3>

					<h3>First, A Little Background</h3>
					<p>I'm a maker at heart.  My degree is in electrical engineering, and I love to play around with all sorts of things in mechanics, electronics, and software.  
					Unforetunately, it's to the point where my identity as a maker competes with my identity as a Christian.  They don't directly interfere with each other, but if you asked me what I identified as first, it might be as a maker instead of a Christian.  That shouldn't be the case.</p>
					
					<h3>Why I Almost De-converted (left Christianity)</h3>
					<p>I've always had some struggles with my faith, but I came to an all-time spiritual low point after an accident where I broke my right arm in February 2024.  It was worse then the breaks surgeons usually deal with.  They usually use 2 steel plates to fix the break, but they had to use 3 for mine.  As a result, my right arm (and hand) were completely useless for 3 weeks, so I couldn't do any project work at all and had difficults doing everything else.  However, even when the bandages came off, I still couldn't move my arm enough to work on projects.  As I went through physical therapy to strenthen and stretch my arm, I ended up not touching any of my projects for several months.  That didn't do my mental health any favors.</p>
					<p>Christians talk about "feeling" God's love and presence.  I've always struggled with this.  When I see people with their hands raised in worship, I wonder what they have that I'm missing.  I've never felt led to do that.  I've never felt any real emotion connected with faith.  In April 2024, that struggle hit its peak, as I felt <b>absolutely nothing</b>.  I began to suspect that if God existed, He/It wasn't the God of the Bible.  I seriously doubt I could be an atheist, but I can see myself becoming agnostic...and almost did.  Well-meaning believers might suggest that I spend more time in prayer or reading the Bible.  However, the problem was most likely something the Church rarely talks about. </p>
					<p>A common social rule is that men aren't supposed to "talk about their feelings".  I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  It turns out that depression can  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindandsoulfoundation.org/Articles/588662/Is_my_lack_of.aspx">profoundly diminish</a> someones ability to experience God's love and presence. That linked article answered my question as to why other people seem to feel God's love when I can't.</p>
					<h3>Why I Didn't</h3>
					<p>Often times, atheists and agnostics will bring up a lack of evidence when they talk about Christianity, and religion in general.  Ironically, the biggest reason why I stayed a believer was the historical evidence that I knew about, particularly with <a target="_empty" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D44">Tacitus</a>, who despised the early Christians.  While he doesn't give direct evidence of the Resurrection, it does raise the question that, if it was a hoax, how do you explain why so many people were willing to die so painfully after having witnessed (or at least heard about) Jesus' crucifixion and death?  Sometimes, unanswered questions can be more compelling evidence than the answers, themselves.</p>
					<h3>The Start of Christian Skeptics</h3>
					<p>I first had the idea for Christian Skeptics back in 2023, but I had other projects that I wanted to work on.  Well...God had a solution for that problem.  My accident put a hard stop to everything, and, to some degree, reset my mindset.  Later that year, I bought Mark Noll's book "The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind", which starts with the sentence "The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is not much of an evangelical mind".  I also started reading the book "Is the Bible True" by Jeffery Sheler, a religion journalist for U.S. News and World Report.</p>
					<p>For a long time, I've been rather jealous of fellow Christians who seemed so sure about their faith, and so close to God.  We talk about a close personal relationship with Jesus Christ, but it's never felt that "close" for me.  We also talk about the Bible as the "Word of God".  I do believe that much of the the Bible is inspired by God and holds the highest spiritual authority, but I don't believe that the entirety of the Bible are the literal words of God.  I'm not a Creationist.  I used to feel that the skeptic in me was a liability to my faith, but now I'm starting to see it a gift from God, Himself.</p>
					<p>Christian Skepticism is about looking for, and careful vetting and critiquing, outside historical and archeological facts as evidence for Christianity and the Bible.  It's also about understanding the Bible by putting that historical knowledge above theology as the foundation for interpretation, and not being afraid to go into the "scary" parts of the Bible that "anti-believers" would use to tear down our faith. Finally, it's about questioning some of the doctrines and beliefs that don't directly concern the person and ministry of Jesus Christ.</p>
