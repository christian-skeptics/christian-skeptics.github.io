						<h3><bold>What are the REAL fundamentals of Christianity?</bold></h3>
						<br>
						<p >Historically, Christian fundamentalism was a reaction to the late 19th century liberal theology that resulted from the Age of Enlightenment.  Liberal Christianity placed reason and modern knowledge over traditional doctrinal authority, and sought to view traditional Christian belief through the lens of natural explanations.  In some cases, this has gone as far as denying the deity of Christ, and focusing on his teachings, instead.</p>
						<br>
						<p >Fundamentalism’s initial intent was to defend essential beliefs of Christianity.  These are Christ’s deity, atoning death, and Resurrection, as well as the Bible’s authority, though they expanded the scope of that authority into areas of facts and evidence.  Fundamentalists also considered Biblical inerrancy to be an essential doctrine, even though it wasn’t considered to be official doctrine in mainstream Protestantism and Catholicism, at the time.</p>

						<p >This is the "3-legged stool" of Christianity.  There is <b>no</b> compromise on this.  If you remove one of the legs, Christianity comes crashing down.</p>
						<p>There are, however, variations or disagreements on the details of each of those "legs".  </p>
						
						<p>Jesus was fully man <b>and</b> fully God.  The deity of Christ is explicitly mentioned in the Bible, with Thomas the Doubter exclaiming <i>"My Lord and my God!</i>" in John 20:28.  It is also stated in John 1:1 <i>"...the Word was <b>with</b> God and the the Word <b>was</b> God"</i>.  The original Greek word for "Word" is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos"><b>Logos</b></a>, which has a much deeper meaning than "word", such as Divine Reason, and likely originated from Greek philosophy.  While the word "Trinity" is not explicitly used in the Bible, it is implied with phrases like "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit".  There is also John 8:58 <i>"...before Abraham was, I am"</i>.  This verse is particularly intriguing, as Jesus seems to claim two things.  First, in addition to being the Son, He also <b>IS</b> the Father, Yahweh (also see Isaiah 9:6, "Everlasting Father").  Second, He exists simultaneously in the past and present, and thus must exist outside of time, as we understand it.</p>
						<br>
						<p >Jesus' death on the cross comes from the Old Testament Jewish tradition of sacrificing an unblemished animal, often a lamb, for the sins of the people or an individual.  He is often referred to as the "Lamb Of God", where God offers His own Son as a perfect, sinless final sacrifice for all the sins of humanity, substituting Christ in place of a fallen humanity.  It is formally referred to as the Substitutionary Atonement, or just Atonement.  An Old Testament foreshadowing of this comes when God tests Abraham by telling him to sacrifice Isaac <b>(Genesis 22)</b>, his only son with Sarah, where, at the last moment, the Angel of the Lord stops Abraham and provides a ram to sacrifice in Isaac's place.</p>
						<br>
						<p >Jesus' Resurrection from the dead defeated sin, death, and Satan.  It also proved His Deity.  While Jesus' life and death are broadly accepted by historians and scholars, the Resurrection is highly debated.  There are records from Roman, Greek, and Jewish historians of His life and death, but nothing about His Resurrection.  However, this may be because it was so scandalous and embarrassing for both the Jewish and the Roman authorities: <b>They killed the Messiah, the Son of God!</b>  To record it was to acknowledge that it really happened.  Think of all the scandals that politicians and the wealthy elites try to cover-up.</p>
						<br>
						<p >However, while there is no record of the Resurrection outside of the Bible, there are independent (non-Christian) historical records that could be used as evidence to make a compelling case for it.  One such <a target="_empty" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D44"><b>record</b></a> was written by Cornelius Tacitus, a well known and respected historian in ancient Rome who, it would seem, did not hold the early Christians in high regard.</p>
						<br>

						<h3>Biblical Authority</h3>
						<br>
						<p >As has been mentioned elsewhere on this site, arguably the most direct statement regarding the authority of the Bible is <b>2nd Timothy 3:16</b>, where Paul states “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness…”.  In matters of faith, Christian living, and prophecy, the Bible has the ultimate authority.  However, fundamentalist Christianity has extended this authority beyond the boundaries of spirituality and into areas that were, very likely, never intended or considered by the authors.  This is primarily the case with natural science, although history has probably also been affected by this encroachment.</p>
						<br>
						<p >British theologian and Anglican bishop <a target="_empty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright"><b>N.T. Wright</b></a> takes a different, intriguing <a target="_empty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright"><b>approach</b></a> on the subject of the Bible's authority.  In this article, he suggests that evangelical Christians, particularly in North America, have approached the Bible as a book of rules and doctrines, instead of a narrative of God deeply desiring a relationship with humanity.</p>
