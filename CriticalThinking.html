					<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>

				<div id="Content" class="row scroll-container">
					<p>Before discussing critical thinking, the first rule that must be carefully followed is to not over-think the process of critical thinking.  Use the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid.  <i>This is not as easy as it might sound.</i></p>
					<br>
					<p>There are a variety of definitions of critical thinking, some of which are definitely not simple.  
					Wikipedia has <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#Definitions"> several</a>, 
					and Monash University has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.monash.edu/student-academic-success/enhance-your-thinking/critical-thinking">several pages</a> that go into detail about each step of the process.  A very simple and general definition is “Analysis of facts to form a conclusion”.  In Christianity, an example of critical thinking could be analyzing and, <i>when possible</i>, verifying the Scriptures, mostly in the area of history.  For the sake of integrity and credibility, we <i>must</i> acknowledge when we are unable to verify the Scriptures.  The process uses a knowledge of history (from a trusted, but independent, outside source), culture, and languages to get deeper insight into what is actually happening and/or being said in a verse or chapter.</p>
					<br>
					<div id="PartsCriticalThinking", class="scroll-page">
						<h3><bold>Parts of Critical Thinking</bold></h3>
						<br>
						<p>At a minimum, there are two parts to critical thinking:</p>
						<br>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Facts</b> from a source that is trusted and independent.  It is crucial that the source be independent, which, in this context, generally means secular, as opposed to a religious source that could be biased towards Christianity.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Logical reasoning</b>, in it’s various forms, to analyze claims against Christianity and to create strong claims for Christianity using independent facts.  However, we must also understand that it is impossible to logically prove matters of faith, as once the foundations of Christianity are proven true, it is no longer a matter of faith.  Indeed, God may have intentionally set up the universe such that His existence <i>cannot</i> be proven.</li>
						</ol>
						<br>
						<p>Again, the importance of integrity and honesty in this process cannot be overstated.  Christian apologetics has reputation for  dishonesty, and that reputation is very likely deserved.</p>
						<br>

					<div id="TypesReasoning", class="scroll-page">
						<h3>Types of Reasoning</h3>
						<br>
						<p>There are 4 types of reasoning.  The two most common types are deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning.  After those, there are also abductive reasoning and analogical reasoning.</p>
						<br>
						<p ><b>Deductive reasoning</b> is the use of a general theory or concept and applying more specific additional statements to narrow down to a specific conclusion that is considered 100% true.  The most famous example starts with the general theory that “All men are mortal”.  It is followed by a specific statement that “Socrates is a man”, which narrows to the conclusion that “Socrates is mortal”.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>Inductive reasoning</b>, on the other hand, takes a number of consistent observations or facts, and draws a more general conclusion or theory. The scientific method is a form of inductive reasoning.</p>
						<br>
						<p ><b>Abductive reasoning</b> seeks the most likely explanation, given a set of observations.  The following is one of Sherlock Holmes' more famous quotes:</p>
						<br>
						<p class="bold-center">When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.</p>
						<br>
						<p style="text-indent: 0px;">A principle called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam's Razor</a> states that, among multiple explanations for an event or phenomenon, the one that is the simplest and makes the fewest assumptions is generally the best.  This reasoning is often used by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_competing_hypotheses">intelligence analysts at agencies like the CIA and FBI</a> to decide what most likely happened or is likely to happen.  While it gives the most likely explanation, it does not eliminate doubt or the possibility of error.  The conclusions of intelligence analyses generally have a "confidence level" applied to them. </p>
						<br>
						<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><i>Of the three types of reasoning described, so far, abductive reasoning is likely to be the most useful for supporting the claims of Christianity.</i></p>
						<br>
						<p ><b>Analogical reasoning</b> is the use of analogies or parallels to argue a point or solve a problem.  A fairly common method of analogical reason found in a variety of professions is using scale models or mock-ups of something to solve a problem or think through a design.  Jesus’ parables could be seen as a form of analogical reasoning or explanation.</p>

						<h3><bold>Terminology Regarding Facts</bold></h3>
						<br>
						<p >In critical thinking, we must first understand several key terms in the context of statements and claims of fact.  A famous line from <cite><i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i></cite> comes from the scene where Dr. Jones (Indy) is teaching an archaeology class:</p>
						
						<p class="bold-center">"Archaeology is the search for fact, not truth. If it's truth you're interested in, Dr. Tyree's Philosophy class is right down the hall."</p>
						<br>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Empirical:</b> (Oxford Dictionary) "based on, concerned with, or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic."</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Fact:</b> any tangible, real-world statement that can verified through demonstration or other <i>empirical</i> methods.  It is a concept mostly used in natural science and history.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Evidence:</b> a fact used to validate another statement.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Truth:</b> a more abstract statement most often used in philosophy (logic) and mathematics.  Truth could be seen as a "universally accepted fact" although, unlike facts, truth cannot be verified using empirical methods, like experiments.  In <b>John 18:38</b> when Jesus talks about Truth, Pilate retorts "What is truth?".  This is not to say that truth cannot have an absolute basis.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Proof:</b> anything that demonstrates, with 100% certainty, that something is true.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Myth:</b> (from the Oxford Dictionary) "a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events".  Unfortunately, it is most commonly used as a slang, to indicate a false belief, and it's correct meaning has been obscured.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Hypothesis:</b> a preliminary explanation for a set of observed facts.  It is generally the result of inductive reasoning.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Theory:</b> a hypothesis that has been thoroughly tested by further experimentation.</li>							
							<br>
						</ol>
						<p>There are three types of evidence: <b>scientific, historical, and archaeological</b>.  Science has become the most popular way to try to prove or disprove the existence of God.  However, natural science is fundamentally incapable of doing either, as natural science is confined to explaining and studying the universe, and, assuming God created the universe, He must exist outside of the 4-dimensional (space-time) universe, as we know it.  History is the “systematic study of the past” using various sources (typically records or other types of documents).  While history is not considered as reliable and objective as natural science, it can be used to verify past events and connect them together to propose hypothesis of other events.  Archaeology can serve as a type of historical source when more straightforward records have not been found.</p>
						<br>
						<p >There are two types of proof: <b>direct proof</b>, and <b>indirect proof</b> (also known as proof by contradiction).  Direct proof is the simplest and most commonly used proof, where something is proven true.  Proof by contradiction (PbC), on the other-hand, is a bit more complex.  PbC tries to prove something true by demonstrating that it cannot be false.  A simple example could be an alibi given by someone suspected of a crime who claims to be innocent.  Someone else says the suspect was with them somewhere else at the time the crime was committed and therefore could not have committed the crime.  They can't be guilty, so they must be innocent.</p>
						<br>
					</div>							
					<div id="BoundariesAuthority", class="scroll-page">
						<h3><bold>Boundaries of Authority</bold></h3>
						<br>
						<p>One of the core beliefs of evangelicalism, and especially fundamentalism, is the authority of the Bible.  While this certainly is a foundational belief in Christianity, it is often taken too far, resulting in the Bible given ultimate authority in areas where it should not have the highest authority (history), and even where it should have little to no authority (natural science).  The same can be said for natural science, where atheists and agnostics will argue that evolution has proven God’s existence and Creationism to be fictitious (or at least unnecessary), as we now have a better understanding of how life came to be (although our understanding is still limited).</p>
						<br>
						<p>The Bible has no more authority in matters of natural science than a history book has in solving a math problem.  They are mutually exclusive, not because they are in conflict, but because they are completely different subjects, having no overlap.  Again, in <b>2nd Timothy</b>, Paul states “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for <i>teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness…</i>”.  The Bible is, first and foremost, a document about faith, spirituality, Christian living, and prophecy, and holds the highest authority only in those specific topics.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Likewise, natural science has no authority or relevance in matters of religion and spiritually, both of which can be  categorized as supernatural.  More specifically, natural science is not capable of proving or disproving God’s existence.  Assuming God created the universe, He must exist outside of it.  Natural science is limited to the study and understanding of the universe, thus it cannot be applied to anything outside of the universe.</p>
