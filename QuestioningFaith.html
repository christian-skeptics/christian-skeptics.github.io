					<h3>Questioning Faith</h3>
				</div>
				<div id="Content" class="row scroll-container">
					<p style="text-indent:25px;"><b>Mark 10:15</b> says we must become like children to enter the Kingdom of God.  This is generally meant by approaching with trust, humility, and dependency.  However, there is another characteristic children are also known for:
	<b>asking a lot of questions!</b>  English philosopher John Locke said “There is frequently more to be learned from the unexpected questions of a child than the discourses of man”.</p>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent:25px;">Many believers will, at some point in their life, start questioning their faith and having doubts about some of their beliefs.  They  may also feel this is a sign of weak faith, and for fear of being judged for this by fellow believers, they could end up stuggling in silence, with the Enemy whispering “Everyone else seems strong in <b>their</b> faith and filled with God’s joy.  Why aren’t <b>you</b>?  What’s wrong with you?”   This doubt could be the result of a negative event or situation in their life (wondering if God is truly good), learning about some fact that would seem to contradict some part of their beliefs (wondering if God is real), or what seems to be a contradiction between to passages in the Bible.  In psychology, this is called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance </a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent:25px;">While we may fear doubt, it can sometimes be a <b>good</b> thing!  It's important to keep in mind that, while unbelief is a sin, doubt is <b>not</b> unbelief.  Even Jesus was tempted.  The saying “In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity” is often attributed to Albert Einstein, and refers to using a difficulty as a chance to learn and grow.  You may heard phrases like “learning experience” or “teachable moment” in the context of learning from a mistake.</p>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent:25px;">In the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gecko (played my Michael Douglas) gives the following famous monologue:</p>
					<br>
					<p style="margin-left:250px; margin-right:250px; font-size:20;"><b>“...greed...for lack of a better word...is good.  Greed is right.  Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.”</b></p>
					<br>
					<p style="text-indent:25px;">There is no question that greed is bad, a sin, and can even be destructive.  In the context of faith, doubt is often seen as bad, and potentially destructive.  Like greed, doubt can also clarify and "cut through”.  It can worry us, or it can motivate us to fill a gap in our understanding.  Approached constructively, doubt can teach us much more than we would have learned without it. </p>
