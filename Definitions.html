					<h3>Definitions</h3>
				</div>
				<div id="Content" class="row scroll-container">
					<p>The concept of a definition is very simple, but, in certain areas, the practice of it can be quite difficult and complex.  For instance, you may have a definition for a term, but is it the correct definition?  How do you know it is the correct definition?</p>
					<br>
					<p>In the hard sciences, definitions tend to be stable and accepted by those in a given field, once a theory has solidified.  In subjects like theology, however, definitions can vary between religions and denominations, even within a denomination.  In Christianity, for instance, there are different definitions for words like “predestination” and “inerrancy”.  There is a wide spectrum of meaning for predestination between Calvinism and Arminianism.  Although St. Augustine professed a form of inerrancy in a <a target="_blank" href="https://byfaithweunderstand.com/2015/06/03/augustine-on-inerrancy/">letter to Faustus the Manichaean</a>, the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy didn’t truly formalize until 19th century American Protestanism.  Within the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy, the definition of “error” may be what causes the most confusion.  What about percieved incompatibilities with science?  If the history as presented in the Bible does not align with history that has been confirmed by most experts of that time and place, is that considered an “error”?</p>
					<br>
					<p>There can be disagreements about definitions in theology and interpretation, and the stubborn disagreements can cause significant divisions, as Paul mentioned in <b>1st Corinthians Chapter 1</b>, and even accusations of heresy.  However, if one side is truly wrong, division is unforetunately necessary to preserve the Truth <b>(Titus 3:10)</b>.  Possibly the most well known heresy is Gnosticism, which states that salvation is attained through mystic or esoteric knowledge.  There is also Arianism (not to be confused with Aryanism), which denies the divinity of Christ.  As divisive as heresies can be, they can actually be useful.  Just as God can use evil actions to accomplish His own purposes, heresies can be used to emphasize right doctrine by pointing out <b><u>why</u></b> they are heresies.</p>
